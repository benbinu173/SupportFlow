# SupportFlow

> AI-assisted customer support, built for modern support teams.

A multi-tenant customer support and helpdesk platform. Support teams work tickets
through a validated lifecycle, assisted by AI for classification, sentiment,
summarization, and draft replies — with a human always in the loop before anything
reaches a customer. Each organization keeps a private knowledge base that grounds AI
answers in its own documented policy rather than model invention.

**Status: Phase C of 26.** Repository, tooling, documentation, containerized
infrastructure, and CI are in place. Domain features are not built yet — see
[Roadmap](#roadmap).

## Why this project exists

A demonstration of production-style Python backend engineering: multi-tenant data
isolation proven by tests, asynchronous processing with real work behind it,
retrieval-augmented generation scoped per tenant, and real-time updates that survive
horizontal scaling. The emphasis is architectural quality and security over feature
count.

## Technology

| Layer | Choice |
|---|---|
| Frontend | React 19, TypeScript, Vite, Tailwind 4, TanStack Query, Zustand, React Router |
| Design | Premium agency visual language — Geist / Plus Jakarta Sans, Phosphor light icons, Motion (ADR-010) |
| Backend | Python 3.14, FastAPI, Pydantic v2, SQLAlchemy 2.x, Alembic |
| Database | PostgreSQL 17 + pgvector |
| Cache / messaging | Redis 8 |
| Background jobs | Celery + beat |
| AI | Provider-agnostic interface; Claude for generation, separate embedding provider |
| Storage | S3-compatible (MinIO locally) |
| Testing | pytest, Vitest, Testing Library |
| Infrastructure | Docker Compose, GitHub Actions |

Library choices that deviate from convention — Argon2id over bcrypt, PyJWT over
python-jose, opaque refresh tokens over JWTs — are justified in
[docs/architecture-decisions.md](docs/architecture-decisions.md).

## Documentation

| Document | Contents |

| [docs/architecture.md](docs/architecture.md) | Component diagram, layering, auth / tenancy / AI / RAG / real-time / job flows |

## Local setup

**Prerequisites:** Docker Desktop, Python 3.12+, Node 22+.

```bash
# 1. Environment
cp .env.example .env
python -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_urlsafe(48))"   # paste into JWT_SECRET

# 2. Infrastructure — Postgres, Redis, MinIO, Mailpit
docker compose up -d

# 3. Backend
cd backend
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/Scripts/activate        # Windows; use bin/activate on macOS/Linux
pip install -e ".[dev]"
uvicorn app.main:app --reload

# 4. Frontend (new terminal)
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

| Service | URL |
|---|---|
| Frontend | http://localhost:5173 |
| API docs | http://localhost:8000/docs |
| Health | http://localhost:8000/health |
| MinIO console | http://localhost:9001 |
| Mailpit | http://localhost:8025 |

Infrastructure runs in Docker while application processes run natively — Celery's
prefork pool is unavailable on Windows and bind-mount file watching degrades reload
performance. Rationale in ADR-007. For container parity:

```bash
docker compose --profile full up --build
```

## Environment variables

All configuration is environment-driven; see [.env.example](.env.example) for the full
template. Secrets have no defaults — the application refuses to start without them
rather than falling back to something insecure.

| Variable | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `DATABASE_URL` | PostgreSQL connection (required) |
| `REDIS_URL` | Cache and pub/sub (required) |
| `JWT_SECRET` | Access-token signing; minimum 32 characters (required) |
| `CORS_ORIGINS` | Comma-separated allowlist. No wildcard — the refresh cookie needs credentials |
| `AI_API_KEY` / `AI_MODEL` | Generation provider |
| `S3_*` | Object storage for attachments |

## Commands

```bash
# Backend (from backend/)
pytest                      # tests
pytest -m security          # tenant-isolation and authz tests only
ruff check . && ruff format --check .
mypy app alembic

# Frontend (from frontend/)
npm test
npm run typecheck
npm run build
```

A [Makefile](Makefile) wraps the common combinations (`make test`, `make check`,
`make ci`).

## Database migrations

Schema changes go through Alembic — `Base.metadata.create_all` is used by the test
suite only, never to evolve a real database.

```bash
make migrate              # apply everything outstanding
make migration m="add ticket tags"   # autogenerate from model changes
make downgrade            # revert the most recent migration
make migration-sql        # print the DDL without running it
make migration-check      # fail if models and migrations have drifted
```

Equivalent direct commands, from `backend/`:

```bash
alembic upgrade head
alembic revision --autogenerate -m "add ticket tags"
alembic downgrade -1
alembic upgrade head --sql
alembic check
```

Notes:

- **There is no database URL in `alembic.ini`, deliberately.** The DSN carries a
  password and that file is committed. Alembic reads `DATABASE_URL` through
  `app.core.config`, so `alembic.ini` cannot drift from the application's own
  connection settings. To target a different database, set `DATABASE_URL` in the
  environment.
- **Autogenerated migrations are a draft, not a result.** Read the generated file
  before committing it. Autogenerate cannot see enum value removals, data
  migrations, or constraint changes that need a backfill.
- **Every migration must be reversible.** `upgrade head` then `downgrade base` is
  asserted in [tests/integration/test_migrations.py](backend/tests/integration/test_migrations.py),
  along with a drift check that fails when a model change has no matching migration.
  Native enum types are the usual trap: they outlive the tables that used them, so a
  downgrade has to drop them explicitly.

## Security posture

Implemented in Phase C:

- Secrets have no defaults and are validated at startup; `JWT_SECRET` under 32
  characters is rejected outright.
- `.gitignore` excludes all `.env` files except the template.
- CORS uses an explicit origin allowlist, never a wildcard.
- OpenAPI docs are disabled when `ENVIRONMENT=production`.
- Health endpoints disclose booleans only — no hostnames, no connection strings.
  A test asserts this.
- The production image runs as a non-root user and excludes tests and build
  artifacts.
- Ruff runs `bandit` security rules across the codebase.

Designed and documented, enforced in later phases: tenant isolation at three layers
(context, repository, schema), Argon2id password hashing, revocable rotating refresh
tokens, centralized RBAC, Redis-backed rate limiting, upload validation, and treating
AI output as untrusted until schema-validated. See
[docs/architecture.md](docs/architecture.md) §5 and
[docs/requirements.md](docs/requirements.md) §7.

Cross-tenant reads return `404`, not `403` — a `403` would confirm a record exists in
another organization and allow ID enumeration (ADR-009).

## Known limitations

- One migration exists: the baseline. There is no upgrade path *from* an older schema
  yet, because the baseline is the first revision.
- The test suite builds its schema with `Base.metadata.create_all` rather than by
  applying migrations. That keeps tests fast, and the drift check in
  [tests/integration/test_migrations.py](backend/tests/integration/test_migrations.py)
  is what stops the two from diverging.
- The embedding provider is deliberately undecided until Phase X (ADR-008).
- The deployment target is undecided; nothing in the architecture depends on a
  specific cloud.
- On Windows, the API must be started with
  `--loop app.core.event_loop:loop_factory` (`make api` includes it). See ADR-011.
